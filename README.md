Features
------------

* **Behavioural Security for your application** — With AuthMe, you can authenticate the user without any password and get a signed response from AuthMe identifying the user for authentication.

* **Get a Security Score for each user login** — We include a score for each user login which you can use in your decisioning process to improve the trust on the user.

* **Super convienent for users, nothing to type** — User does not required a keyboard, and does not have to wait for any SMS based OTP

* **Push authentication based security** — A transparent flow for both the User and the Server, protecting both from online frauds.

* **Multiple layes of protection** A pattern with behaviour identification with an TOTP from an identified device with brute force detection. Everything happens over SSL

* **Can be used from devices with no interface** In an Oauth2 flow, the resource in not necessarily going to have an interface/input device. Password based authentication systems inherently do not fit such devices.

* **Stay conntected to your users** —
